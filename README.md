# iob-api
The IOB-API (Isle of Berk API) is the official API for the Minecraft Mod "Isle of Berk". The api is developed by Hexagon Software (no, were not the mod devs, we just make the API). The API comes alongside the IOB Framework used in the sourcecode.
The API aims at providing utilities for creating custom Entities and creating an "Expansion Pack" for Isle of Berk.
This API will register any custom entity under the Mod ID of Isle of Berk.
